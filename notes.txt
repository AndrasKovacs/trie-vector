investigate + bench

- small tail optimization: only keep n elements for some n < m in the tail and use out-of-line copy
  - can be used all along the right edge of the trie as well

- Drop "level" field from vector, instead recompute level with popcount from size

- Variant of Vector that always has at least 1 element in tail

- Find out why concatenation via bulk/optimized snoccing isn't effective
