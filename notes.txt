TODO

    unsafe operations should run in a single ST block!
    else inlining fucks things up
    maybe we should let unsafe operations be for a while
        the chunked array copy can be done without unsafe ops

refactor/simplify code (throw out mask?)

ord
eq
append
    versions
        safe snoc
        copy right edge then unsafe snoc
        fold rhs and unsafe copy
        first copy rhs to array, then copy by NODE_WIDTH chunks into destination
            needs stateful fold on bottom arrays rather than elements
traversable
drop
inits
